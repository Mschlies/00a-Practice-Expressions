Practice exercises for variables and assignments

1. Given a template that pre-defines a variable miles, write an assignment statement that defines a variable feet whose value is the number of feet in miles miles.
2. Given a template that pre-defines three variables hours, minutes and seconds, write an assignment statement that updates the variable total_seconds to have a value corresponding to the total number of seconds for hours hours, minutes minutes and seconds seconds.
3. Given a template that pre-defines the variables width and height that are the lengths of the sides of a rectangle, write an assignment statement that defines a variable perimeter whose value is the perimeter of the rectangle in inches.
4. Given a template that pre-defines the variables width and height that are the lengths of the sides of a rectangle, write an assignment statement that defines a variable area whose value is the area of the rectangle in square inches.
5. Given a template that pre-defines the constant PI and the variable radius corresponding to the radius of a circle in inches, write an assignment statement that defines a variable circumference whose value is the circumference of a circle with radius radius in inches.
6. Given a template that pre-defines the constant PI and the variable radius corresponding to the radius of a circle in inches, write an assignment statement that defines a variable area whose value is the area of a circle with radius radius in square inches.
7. Given the pre-defined variables present_value, annual_rate and years, write an assignment statement that define a variable future_value whose value is present_value dollars invested at annual_rate percent interest, compounded annually for years years.
8. Give the pre-defined variables first_name and last_name, write an assignment statement that defines the variable name_tag whose value is the string "My name is % %." where the percents should be replaced by first_name and last_name.
9. Given the pre-defined variables name (a string) and age (a number), write an assignment statement that defines a variable statement whose value is the string "% is % years old." where the percents should be replaced by name and the string form of age.
10. Given the variables x0, y0, x1, and y1, write an assignment statement that defines a variable distance whose values is the distance between the points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1).
11. Challenge: Heron's formula states the area of a triangle is s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√ where a, b and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle and s=12(a+b+c) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. Given the variables x0, y0, x1,y1, x2, and y2, write a Python program that computes a variable area whose value is the area of the triangle with vertices (x0,y0), (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). (Hint: our solution uses five assignment statements.)
